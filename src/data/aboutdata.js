        "I'm rapidly learning exciting web technologies through Thinkfulâ€™s Full Stack bootcamp, focusing on the MERN stack (Mongoose, Express, React, Node). I love bringing great ideas to life by building web apps that are both useful and fun. As a medical doctor and researcher in a former life, I've learned how to master new skills quickly, communicate effectively with people of diverse backgrounds, and manage large amounts of complex information.",
        "When I'm not in front of a keyboard, you'll find me enjoying stereotypical PNW activities like hiking, camping, fishing, gardening, beer tasting, and hunting wild mushrooms.",
        "I am currently seeking a junior developer position in the Portland area. I'm eager both to contribute my existing skills and to learn new tech on the job!"
