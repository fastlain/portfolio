        "I'm a recent graduate of Thinkfulâ€™s Full Stack web development program, focusing on the <span>\"MERN\" stack </span> (MongoDB, Express, React, Node). I love bringing great ideas to life by building web apps that both make life easier and are enjoyable to use. Before changing careers, I worked as a <span>medical doctor and researcher</span>, where I learned to master new skills quickly, communicate effectively with people of diverse backgrounds, and manage large amounts of complex information.",
        "When I'm not in front of a keyboard, you'll find me enjoying stereotypical PNW activities like hiking, camping, fishing, gardening, beer tasting, and foraging for wild mushrooms.",
        "I am currently <span>seeking a junior developer position</span> in the Portland area. I'm eager both to contribute my existing skills and to learn new tech on the job!"
