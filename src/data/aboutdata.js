        "I'm rapidly learning exciting web technologies through Thinkfulâ€™s Full Stack web development program, focusing on the <span>\"MERN\" stack </span> (MongoDB, Express, React, Node). I love bringing great ideas to life by building web apps that both make life easier and are enjoyable to use. As a <span> former medical doctor and researcher</span>, I've learned how to master new skills quickly, communicate effectively with people of diverse backgrounds, and manage large amounts of complex information.",
