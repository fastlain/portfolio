        "I love bringing great ideas to life by building applications that are enjoyable to use and make life and work easier. I graduated from Thinkfulâ€™s Full Stack web development program in 2018, focusing on the \"MERN\" stack (<span>MongoDB, Express, React, Node</span>). Since then, I've been working for 6 Degrees Health, an innovative healthcare startup, where I picked up <span>Go, PostgreSQL, TypeScript, and more</span>.", 
        "Before changing careers, I worked as a medical doctor and researcher, where I learned to master new skills quickly, communicate effectively with people of diverse backgrounds, and manage large amounts of complex information.",
        "When I'm not in front of a keyboard, you'll find me enjoying stereotypical PNW activities like hiking, camping, fishing, gardening, beer tasting, and foraging for wild mushrooms."
